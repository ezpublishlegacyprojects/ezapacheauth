eZ Apache Auth extension for eZ publish
=======================================

Goals:
======

1. Allow to set up Apache to delegate user authentication to eZPublish for
protecting non-php resources such as webdav / subversion shares

2. Allow eZPublish to delegate to Apache user authentication

NB: Goal number 2 is not yet reached as of version 0.1


Prerequisites:
==============

PHP 5 / eZP 4.0+
Apache webserver
Mod-auth-external Apache module (http://code.google.com/p/mod-auth-external/)


Installation:
=============

1. unzip and activate the extension, as always

2. download mod-auth-external, compile it and install it

3. configure Apache to delegate user authentication to eZ Publish for a vhost,
   directory, single file or anything in between

   Example configuration in your vhost:
   
   <Location /myprotectedfolder>
   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "eZPublish accounts"   
   Require valid-user
   ### Auth passed on to ez via mod-auth-external
   AuthBasicProvider external
   ### the name used here is a label that must match the one below
   AuthExternal ezpublish
   </Location>
   ### change the path to the .sh script according to your setup
   DefineExternalAuth ezpublish pipe /var/www/ezpublish/extension/ezapacheauth/bin/shell/authenticate.sh

   Please note that Basic authentication is only recommended together with https!

4. Restart Apache and test accessing the vhost/folder you protected.
   Only eZ Publish user accounts should be valid.


Troubleshooting
===============

. look in the apache error log for messages from mod-auth-external

. test executing /var/www/ezpublish/extension/ezapacheauth/bin/shell/authenticate.sh
  on the command line. It waits for username + [Enter] + password + [Enter], and
  returns a value of 0 for ok, 1 for bad password or username.
  (use the command "echo $?" to display the return value after executing the script)

. make sure the user running the apache process ('www-data', 'apache' or 'httpd'
  depending on your configuration) has enough rights to execute the script
  /var/www/ezpublish/extension/ezapacheauth/bin/shell/authenticate.sh

. read the manual of mod-auth-external

. read the Apache manual about authentication and authorization

. mod-auth-external only supports Basic auth, not Digest auth
